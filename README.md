Dining Hall Page

Issues - There were some issues with the parsing of the JSON file since I have never worked with a complex JSON onject but it was intersting working with Swifty and Alamofire which made work easier.

UI - The UI was intutive however I did not have time to work on the shadows. 

I used a TableViewController to display the dining halls and created 2 sections. 

I dowloaded the links and the names but was unable to link them since I did not have the time to do so.

Overall, it was an intersting challenge that I enjoyed.
